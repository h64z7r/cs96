LAW AND SOCIETY SOC 2403	 			   Section: OL94 (22328)FALL 2024				   Time:  Wednesday 2:30 PM-5:00PMOffice Hours: WED 5:00-6:00 PM and by appointmentPREREQUISITES: CUNY Certification in Reading and Writing and PSY 1101, S0C 1101, GOV 2401 or LS 201CATALOG COURSE DESCRIPTION: Since the legal system was codified there has been an interaction between society and the law. The law is shaped by the values and customs of society, even as it also contributes to cultural change. This course is an attempt to investigate the dynamic interplay between various social systems and legal systems. Included is a discussion of both historical and contemporary socio-cultural legal systems, as well as a consideration of the pressures being brought to bear upon our own legal system to be more responsive to the particular needs of specific ethnic, sexual, and religious groups. This course will also show how society shapes the law and the law shapes society. We will discuss culture, socialization, the various legal systems and the organization of the law. We will discuss the relationship of social control and social change on law making and vice versa. Finally, we will describe the sociology of the legal profession.METHOD: Historical and SocraticHOW CONDUCTED: This is an online synchronous class conducted live, in real time.Students will log on to a Zoom link which is set to be recurring:Topic: Law and Soc. 2403 OL94Time: August 24, 2024, 2:30 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)Every week on Wednesday, until December 17, 2024AUGUST 28, 2024 2:30 PMSEPTEMBER 4, 2024 2:30 PMSEPTEMBER 11, 2024 2:30 PMSEPTEMBER 18, 2024 2:30 PMSEPTEMBER 25, 2024 2:30 PMOCTOBER 9, 2024 2:30 PMOCTOBER 16, 2024 2:30 PM (Midterm Presentations)OCTOBER 23, 2024 2:30 PM (Midterm Presentations)OCTOBER 30, 2024 2:30 PMNOVEMBER 6, 2024 2:30 PMNOVEMBER 13, 2024 2:30 PMNOVEMBER 20, 2024 2:30 PMDECEMBER 4, 2024 2:30 PMDECEMBER 11, 2024 2:30 PMDECEMBER 18, 2024 2:30 PM(final)Please download and import the following iCalendar (.ics) files to your calendar system.Gale Elston is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.
